# Interview Scheduler


This comprehensive app allows a user to create, edit, and cancel appointments for interviews. The beauty of this ambiguous app is that users do not know what the interview is for. It could be subterfuge to collect personal data from unwitting students; it could be an interview for the job opportunity of a lifetime, or one to be the new janitor of LHL facilities. The important thing is that some interview is scheduled for some reason at a specific time with a specific person. It is within this gray area that Scheduler thrives. We like to keep our interviewees in the gray. They will be born in it, molded by it. This is the Gray Batman of applications.
